                        The Baroque era (1600-1750) was known for its dramatic, expressive music and ornate style.
                        Composers
                        like Bach, Vivaldi, and Handel used contrast, emotion, and complex harmonies to create music
                        that
                        was both grand and intimate. This period introduced forms like the concerto, opera, and sonata,
                        and
                        featured instruments such as the harpsichord and violin.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        Baroque music emerged around 1600 in Italy and soon spread across Europe, marking a shift toward
                        expressive, dramatic, and highly structured compositions. It introduced new ideas like tonal
                        harmony
                        and basso continuo, which gave music a clearer sense of direction and emotion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This era saw the birth of opera and the rise of instrumental music as a major art form.
                        Composers
                        like Monteverdi, Vivaldi, and Bach shaped the sound of the time with groundbreaking works that
                        balanced complexity with emotional depth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Baroque period ended around 1750 with the death of Bach, paving the way for the simpler,
                        more
                        balanced style of the Classical era.

                        violin, timpani and various woodwinds and brass instruments. The use of ornamentation and

                        The Classical period (1750-1820) was a time of elegance, clarity, and balance in music.
                        Composers
                        focused on well-structured forms and clear melodies, moving away from the ornamented style of
                        the
                        Baroque era. Music became more accessible to the public, and the rise of public concerts helped
                        shape a new musical culture. Instruments like the piano became central, and genres such as the
                        symphony, sonata, and string quartet flourished.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Classical era emerged after the Baroque period, inspired by the ideals of the
                        Enlightenment—reason, order, and simplicity. Composers emphasized symmetry and emotional
                        restraint,
                        creating music with logical structure and graceful melodies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This period saw the rise of standard musical forms like the sonata, symphony, and concerto, and
                        favored homophonic texture (a single melody with accompaniment). The orchestra grew in size and
                        importance, and the piano gradually replaced the harpsichord.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notable composers include Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven. Their
                        works defined the style of the time and influenced generations to come. The Classical period
                        eventually gave way to the Romantic era, where emotion and individuality would once again take
                        center stage.

                        Instrumentally, the piano replaced the harpsichord as the dominant keyboard instrument. The
                        string
                        section led the orchestra, while woodwinds and brass gained independence and color. Timpani were
                        the
                        primary percussion instrument used for rhythmic emphasis.

                        The Romantic era (1820-1900) was a time of powerful emotion, imagination, and individual
                        expression
                        in music. Composers sought to tell stories, stir deep feelings, and explore the mysteries of the
                        human soul through rich harmonies, dynamic contrasts, and lyrical melodies. Music became more
                        personal and expressive, often inspired by literature, nature, nationalism, and the
                        supernatural.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        Romantic music emerged as a reaction to the order and balance of the Classical era. As Europe
                        experienced revolutions (notably the First Industrial Revolution (1760-1840) and the series of
                        revolutions that took over Europe during 1830-1848) and shifting ideologies,
                        composers began breaking traditional forms to explore freedom and individuality in their work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Orchestras grew in size and range, allowing for more dramatic expression. Composers like
                        Frédéric
                        Chopin, Johannes Brahms, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and Richard Wagner pushed musical boundaries with
                        expressive piano works, expansive symphonies, and grand operas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New genres such as symphonic poems and art songs (Lied) flourished, and the role of the
                        composer
                        as an artist-genius became central. The Romantic era bridged personal emotion and public
                        performance, setting the stage for modern music to follow.

                        instruments like the tuba, celesta, English horn, and saxophone. The piano also rose to

                            A vocal music composition for solo voice and piano, expressing deep emotions and often based
                            on
                            poetry. Composers like Schubert and Schumann excelled in this form, creating intimate
                            musical
                            experiences.

                            A rhapsody in music is a one-movement work that is episodic yet integrated, free-flowing in
                            structure, featuring a range of highly contrasted moods, colour, and tonality. An air of
                            spontaneous inspiration and a sense of improvisation make it freer in form than a set of
                            variations.

                            "Swan Lake" and "Giselle" featured lush orchestral scores and expressive choreography, often
                            exploring themes of love, nature, and the supernatural. Composers like Tchaikovsky and
                            Delibes created iconic ballet scores that remain popular today.

                        The Modern era of music (roughly 1900-present) is marked by innovation, experimentation, and a
                        break
                        from traditional rules. Composers explored new sounds, structures, and technologies, often
                        reflecting the rapid social, political, and technological changes of the 20th and 21st
                        centuries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Music in this era ranges from atonal and abstract compositions to minimalist, electronic, and
                        film
                        music. It includes a wide variety of styles—classical, jazz, pop, rock, and more—all coexisting
                        and
                        influencing each other. The Modern era celebrates freedom of expression, diversity, and constant
                        evolution.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Modern music era began in the early 1900s as composers reacted against the emotional
                        excesses of Romanticism and the traditional structures of earlier periods. This is largely due
                        to the rapid changes in society such as the fall of imperialism, the influence and aftermath of
                        the two world wars,
                        the rise of realism and finally the Information Age(1947-present).
                        Pioneers like Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, and Arnold Schoenberg introduced bold new ideas
                        such as atonality,
                        polytonality, and rhythmic complexity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 20th century also saw the rise of electronic instruments, recording technology, and film
                        scoring, which transformed how music was composed, performed, and shared. Later movements like
                        minimalism, serialism, and experimental music continued to challenge musical norms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In recent decades, the blending of genres, global influences, and digital tools has led to a
                        highly diverse musical landscape. Today, classical music coexists with electronic, jazz, world
                        music,
                        and more, all shaping what we consider "modern." We call this contemporary music, which is a
                        term that encompasses a wide range of musical styles and genres that are currently being created
                        and performed.

                    <p>
                        The Modern era expanded the range of musical instruments through innovation and experimentation.
                        Traditional instruments like the piano and violin were played in new, creative ways. Electronic
                        instruments such as synthesizers and drum machines introduced entirely new sounds. Composers
                        also
                        used unusual objects and global instruments, blending cultures and styles. Percussion became
                        more
                        prominent, and technology reshaped how music was created and performed.

                        <h4>Atonal Music</h4>
                        <p>
                            Atonal music lacks a tonal center, avoiding traditional harmonic structures. Composers like
                            Arnold Schoenberg and Sergei Prokofiev explored this style, creating music that challenges
                            conventional listening experiences.

                            Minimalism is characterized by repetitive patterns, simple harmonies, and gradual changes.
                            Composers like Steve Reich and Philip Glass created hypnotic, meditative works that focus on
                            texture and rhythm.

                            Electronic music uses technology to create sounds and manipulate recordings. It includes
                            genres
                            like techno, house, and ambient music. Pioneers like Karlheinz Stockhausen and Brian Eno
                            pushed
                            the boundaries of sound through electronic experimentation.
